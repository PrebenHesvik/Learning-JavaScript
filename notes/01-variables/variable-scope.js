    // let and const
        // if assigned inside a func then only avaiable inside the func
        // if assigned in a block of code (loop, if statement) then only
            // available inside that block (block scoped)
    // var
        // if assigned inside a func then only avaiable inside the func
        // available outiside the block scope (not block scoped)
        // variables assigned using var can be reassigned again using var
        // var is also hoisted (look at hoisting in javascript)
            // able to reference a function that has been declared later
            // in the script without getting an error
